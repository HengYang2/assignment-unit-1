If I were to run the "ls" command in an empty folder nothing whould show up - which makes sense because there is nothing to display.
If I were to run the "ls" command in a folder with children inside of it, it would display the names of all the directories and files it contains.

git version 2.33.0

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?

a list of edits that haven't been stagged, and a list of stagged edits that are ready to be committed.

The 'git add .' command stages your uncommited edits.
Once the uncommitted edits are staged, you can commit them to your local pc using the "git commit -m ''"
command.
